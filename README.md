## Windows Active Directory (AD) â€“ Centralized Identity & Access Management
**Windows Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that helps manage users, computers, and resources in a network. It is used in enterprise environments to provide centralized authentication, authorization, and security policies.**

## Key Features:
**âœ… User & Group Management â€“ Centralized control over user accounts, groups, and permissions.
âœ… Authentication & Authorization â€“ Uses Kerberos and LDAP for secure user logins.
âœ… Group Policy Management â€“ Enforces security settings, software installations, and network configurations.
âœ… Single Sign-On (SSO) â€“ Users can access multiple applications with one set of credentials.
âœ… Domain Services â€“ Organizes network resources into domains, forests, and organizational units (OUs).**
## Why Use Active Directory?
**ðŸ”¹ Centralized Security â€“ Manages access control across the organization.
ðŸ”¹ Scalability â€“ Supports thousands of users, devices, and applications.
ðŸ”¹ Integration â€“ Works with Microsoft services like Azure AD, Exchange, and SharePoint.
ðŸ”¹ Improved Productivity â€“ Users sign in once and access multiple resources without re-entering credentials.**
## Common Use Cases:
**Enterprise IT Management â€“ Controlling access to corporate networks and devices.
User Authentication & SSO â€“ Secure logins for employees across applications.
Access Control & Security â€“ Implementing policies for passwords, firewalls, and permissions.**
Windows Active Directory is essential for managing and securing enterprise networks, ensuring efficient user and resource management. ðŸš€
